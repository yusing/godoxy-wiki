title: Health monitoring
description: Configure health monitoring for GoDoxy
---

## Behaviors

- Health monitoring is enabled by default for all services, including the excluded ones.
- If docker healthcheck<sup className="font-bold">1</sup> is enabled, it will be used first. In this case, `use_get` and `path` will be ignored.
- In case docker healthcheck is not available (not enabled / failed to fetch), **GoDoxy** healthcheck will be used.
- You can disable health monitoring by setting `healthcheck.disable: true` in the route file<sup className="font-bold">2</sup> or in the docker labels<sup className="font-bold">3</sup>.

### References

1. Health check in [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/#healthcheck) and [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck), e.g.

   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost"]
     interval: 1m30s
     timeout: 10s
     retries: 3
     start_period: 40s
     start_interval: 5s
   ```

2. Disable health monitoring in route file

   ```yaml
   app:
     host: 10.0.0.1
     port: 8080
     healthcheck:
       disable: true
   ```

3. Docker labels

   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       labels:
         proxy.#1.healthcheck.disable: true
   ```

## Implementations

| Healthcheck Type | Method                                                                  | Healthy Condition                           | Unhealthy Condition                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| HTTP             | Sends `HEAD` or `GET` request to specified `path` (default: `/`)        | Server replies with a non-5xx HTTP response | Connection failure/error, 5xx reply |
| TCP/UDP          | Dials a TCP or UDP connection to upstream server                        | Connection is established                   | Connection cannot be established    |
| File Server      | Checks if root directory exists and is accessible by GoDoxy (`os.Stat`) | Root directory exists and is accessible     | Otherwise                           |
